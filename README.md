# Toy App

This is the second application for the Ruby on Rails Tutorial by Michael Hartl.

This app is generated with a scaffold that takes user names,emails, and microposts. With this app you  can create users and new microposts (which need to have a valid user id attached to them, and cannot be longer than 140 characters long. In order to create microposts, your URL should be .../microposts instead of .../users.

You can see it live [heroku-live](https://secure-fortress-49127.herokuapp.com/)
